> In standard \citet{SS73} thin disk models, large changes in the continuum flux are not permitted over short timescales due to the relatively long viscous time associated with such disks. Given the observed short timescale continuum variations, we must consider more complex models. We note that two of our sources (J1205+3422 and J2228+2201) have \civ\ REW and continuum luminosity changes which fall comfortably along a line, implying their variation is consistent with an intrinsic Baldwin Effect (see Fig. \ref{fig:CIV_Baldwin}). That is, the excitation of the \civ\ line is driven by the changes in the continuum; however the excited gas cannot reach an equilibrium excitation state as quickly as the continuum changes, thus the slope of the intrinsic Baldwin Effect line is greater than that of the overall (ensemble) slope, which is derived from many single-epoch observations, the majority of which are assumed to be in equilibrium.
> The presence of an intrinsic Baldwin Effect implies those sources may comfortably fit into the sample of \civ\ variable quasars explored by \citet{Dyer2019}. Similar to those authors, we consider slim accretion disk models e.g., \citet[][]{Abramowicz1988} which may explain the observed variability. In particular, we note the summary timescales for disk variation in \citet{Stern2018}, which are shorter for taller disks, permitting changes similar to those observed if they are caused by heating or cooling fronts propagating on the disk sound crossing time. \citet{Dyer2019} also consider inhomogeneous disk models
> \citep[e.g.][]{DexterAgol2011} where flux variations are driven by azimuthal inhomogeneities in the temperature of the disk. Such inhomogeneities could arise from disk instabilities \citep[e.g.][]{LightmanEardley1974} or interactions of embedded objects \citep[e.g.][]{McKernanetal2014,McKernanetal2018}. If an inhomogeneous disk is responsible for the continuum variations, which then drive \civ\ variations, it implies that our objects are simply the extreme outliers produced by a process which rarely but occasionally produces very large hot or cool spots. The frequency of such occurrences can be used to constrain the slope and normalization of the power law distribution of spot size.
> Finally, we must also consider the disk/wind model which has successfully reproduced many features of quasar \civ\ observations, notably the common blueshifted offset \citep[see e.g.,][]{Murrayetal1995}. In this model \civ is very optically thick at low velocities, but optically thin at high velocity, with $\tau \sim 1$ at $\sim 5000{\rm km/s}$. In a disk wind model, the broad line region is very small, implying short-timescales of variability in the lines. Also in this model, there should be associated strong absorption in the soft X-ray band, which can be tested with follow-up observations with Chandra.

> The foregoing discussion directly applies to the two objects which maintain an intrinsic Baldwin Effect relationship between \civ\ REW and continuum luminosity. However, J1638+2827 clearly does not maintain such a relationship--indeed the continuum and \civ\ REW are at least somewhat correlated, rather than anti-correlated in this source. This implies that the illumination of the \civ\ emitting region by a variable ionizing continuum and the corresponding change in the photoionisation state alone cannot explain the collapse and recovery of the line.
