Letter submissions 
In the interests of rapid processing, Letters have an abstract word
limit of 200 words, and must be 5 pages or fewer in length. New Letter
submissions longer than 5 pages may be rejected, with the suggestion
you shorten the paper, or resubmit to MNRAS Main Journal. Letters
should be self-contained and describe the results of an original study
whose rapid publication might be expected to have a significant
influence on the subsequent development of research in the associated
subject area. Authors are required to state their reasons for seeking
publication in the form of a Letter when submitting their manuscript.
